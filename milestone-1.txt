This project strives to create a simple and efficient way for property owners in services such as AirBnB to notify
their customers when their time limit is coming to an end. This will assist both the property owners and customers,
by making it easier to plan around and renew their contracts if necessary. The front end portion of the application
will consist of a login/sign up page(s), a landing page and a page for users to customize things like how many times
the customer should be notified, as well as particular aspects of the schedule they are working with. Ideally, the
user will have access to a number of different host sites (e.g. AirBnB) and they will be able to select one of these.
In regards to the back end, the application will store data from the users and their customers, and send emails as
notification to the customers.
